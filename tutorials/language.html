Language Tags
</h3>

<p>
Languages are represented by {@link http://goo.gl/Lq37Vx ISO 639} language tags
such as "en", "fra-CA", "deu-AT", etc.  Both 2-letter and 3-letter ISO tags are
supported, as are sublanguages.
</p>

<p>
Some languages have both 2-letter and 3-letter tags defined, and some languages
even have more than one 3-letter tag defined.  The DASH spec says that language
tags in an MPD must always be given in their shortest form. This follows {@link
http://goo.gl/9i0UUg BCP 47}.  However, MP4 track metadata always uses 3-letter
tags, and some MPD creation tools use what is in the MP4 track directly.
</p>

<p>
The Shaka Player will normalize all language tags (from MPDs or in the language
preference setting) to their shortest form when they are ingested. Any 3-letter
tag with an equivalent 2-letter tag will be mapped to 2 letters. Languages with
multiple 3-letter tags are also handled through this mapping.  For example, you
could use either of Greek's 3-letter tags ("ell" and "gre"), and both would map
to the 2-letter tag "el".
</p>


<h3 class="tutorial-heading">
Language APIs
</h3>

<p>
The Player library provides APIs to list and select audio and text tracks.  The
audio and text track objects include a language property. This allows a user to
manually change audio or subtitle languages.  There is also an API to enable or
disable the selected subtitles.  See:

<ul>
  <li>{@link shaka.player.Player#getAudioTracks}</li>
  <li>{@link shaka.player.Player#getTextTracks}</li>
  <li>{@link shaka.player.Player#selectAudioTrack}</li>
  <li>{@link shaka.player.Player#selectTextTrack}</li>
  <li>{@link shaka.player.Player#enableTextTrack}</li>
</ul>

<i>
Please note that {@link shaka.player.Player#selectVideoTrack} is also provided,
but can interfere with automatic bitrate adaptation. If you allow your users to
choose video tracks manually, call {@link shaka.player.Player#enableAdaptation}
(false) to disable automatic video adaptation when a manual choice is made.
</i>
</p>

<p>
To avoid the necessity of choosing audio and text tracks manually, Shaka Player
provides {@link shaka.player.Player#setPreferredLanguage an API to set a user's
preferred language}.  The language preference defaults to "en" (English) if not
set.
</p>

Automatic Stream Selection Using Language Preference
</h3>

<p>
When starting a video, the Player will choose streams which best fit the user's
language preference.  This uses a fuzzy matching algorithm for languages.
</p>

<p>
An exact language match is preferred ("en-US" &equiv; "en-US"), followed by the
base language of the user's sublanguage ("en" &sup; "en-US"), followed by other
sublanguages with the same base language ("en-GB" &asymp; "en-US").  If none of
these fuzzy matches work, the first available language from the MPD is used.
</p>

<p>
The matching algorithm can be found in {@link shaka.util.LanguageUtils.match}.
</p>

<p>
The same matching algorithm is used to select both audio and text tracks.  When
no audio track matches the user preference, text tracks are enabled by default.
